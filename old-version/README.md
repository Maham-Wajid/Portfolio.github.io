# Old Version Archive

This directory contains the previous version (v1.0) of the portfolio website.

## Archived Files

These files have been moved here to prevent conflict with the new Next.js application:

- `index.html` - Old main HTML file
- `style.css` - Old custom styles  
- `bootstrap.css` - Old Bootstrap CSS
- `main.js` - Old JavaScript file
- `resume.html` - Old resume page
- `webwork.html` - Old work showcase page
- `sweetAlert.js` - Old alert library
- `forms/` - Old form files
- `assets/` - Old assets directory (kept for image reference)

## Why Archived?

The presence of `index.html` in the root directory was causing web servers to serve the old static site instead of the new Next.js application.

## New Version

The current portfolio (v2.0) uses:
- Next.js 16
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Modern component architecture

See the main README.md for details about the new version.
